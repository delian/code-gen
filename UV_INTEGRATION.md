# UV Integration Summary

This document summarizes how UV (Astral's Python package manager) is integrated throughout the OFDM Chirp Generator project to ensure consistent development environments and reproducible builds.

## Overview

UV is used as the primary tool for:
- **Package Management**: Installing and managing dependencies
- **Virtual Environment Management**: Creating and maintaining isolated environments
- **Task Execution**: Running tests, examples, and development tasks
- **Build Management**: Building and publishing the package

## Project Configuration

### pyproject.toml

The project is configured with UV-specific settings:

```toml
# UV-specific configuration
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
    "black>=22.0.0",
    "isort>=5.10.0",
    "flake8>=5.0.0",
    "mypy>=1.0.0",
]

# UV scripts for common development tasks
[tool.uv.scripts]
test = "pytest tests/ -v"
test-cov = "pytest tests/ --cov=ofdm_chirp_generator --cov-report=html --cov-report=term"
lint = "flake8 ofdm_chirp_generator tests examples"
format = "black ofdm_chirp_generator tests examples"
demo-basic = "python examples/basic_usage.py"
demo-generator = "python examples/ofdm_generator_demo.py"
# ... more scripts
```

### Requirements Integration

UV usage is mandated in the requirements document (Requirement 8):

- **8.1**: UV SHALL be used for virtual environment creation and management
- **8.2**: UV SHALL be used for all package installations and updates
- **8.3**: UV SHALL be used to execute pytest in the managed environment
- **8.4**: UV SHALL be used to ensure consistent Python environment and dependencies

## Task Implementation with UV

Each task in the implementation plan includes UV-specific instructions:

### Task 1: Data Models
```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest tests/test_models.py tests/test_validation.py -v
uv run demo-basic
```

### Task 2: GPU Backend
```bash
uv add cupy-cuda11x cupy-cuda12x  # Optional GPU dependencies
uv run pytest tests/test_gpu_backend.py -v
uv run demo-gpu
```

### Task 3: Chirp Modulation
```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_chirp_modulator.py -v
uv run demo-chirp
```

### Task 4: OFDM Structure
```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_subcarrier_manager.py -v
uv run demo-ofdm
```

### Task 5: Signal Generation Engine
```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_ofdm_generator.py -v
uv run demo-generator
```

## Development Workflow

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Initial setup
git clone <repository>
cd ofdm-chirp-generator
uv sync

# Verify installation
uv run python -c "from ofdm_chirp_generator import OFDMConfig; print('✓ Setup successful!')"
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Sync dependencies (start of day)
uv sync

# Run tests during development
uv run pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v

# Format code
uv run format

# Run quality checks
uv run lint

# Test examples
uv run demo-<feature>
```

### Adding Dependencies

```bash
# Core dependencies
uv add numpy scipy

# Development dependencies
uv add --dev pytest-mock

# Optional dependencies
uv add --optional gpu cupy-cuda11x
uv add --optional visualization matplotlib
```

## Scripts and Automation

### Development Script (scripts/dev.py)

UV-based development script for common tasks:

```bash
python scripts/dev.py setup          # Set up environment
python scripts/dev.py test --cov     # Run tests with coverage
python scripts/dev.py lint           # Run quality checks
python scripts/dev.py demo basic     # Run basic demo
python scripts/dev.py add matplotlib # Add dependency
```

### Makefile Integration

UV commands integrated into Makefile:

```makefile
test:
	uv run pytest -v

install-dev:
	uv sync
	uv pip install -e ".[all]"

format:
	uv run black ofdm_chirp_generator/ tests/ examples/
	uv run isort ofdm_chirp_generator/ tests/ examples/
```

### Setup Script (scripts/setup.py)

UV-focused setup script that:
- Checks for UV installation
- Installs UV if missing
- Sets up project with `uv sync`
- Validates installation with `uv run`

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

CI pipeline uses UV throughout:

```yaml
- name: Install UV
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
  with:
    version: "latest"

- name: Set up Python
  run: uv python install ${{ matrix.python-version }}

- name: Install dependencies
  run: uv sync --all-extras --dev

- name: Run tests
  run: uv run pytest --cov=ofdm_chirp_generator --cov-report=xml
```

## Documentation

### README.md

UV-focused documentation with:
- UV installation instructions
- UV-based quick start guide
- UV commands for all development tasks
- Task-specific UV command examples

### DEVELOPMENT.md

- Automatic dependency conflict resolution
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies

## Verification

### Current Status

All tasks 1-5 have been successfully implemented and tested with UV:

```bash
# Task verification commands
uv run pytest tests/test_models.py tests/test_validation.py -v          # Task 1 ✓
uv run pytest tests/test_gpu_backend.py -v                              # Task 2 ✓
uv run pytest tests/test_chirp_modulator.py -v                          # Task 3 ✓
uv run pytest tests/test_subcarrier_manager.py -v                       # Task 4 ✓
uv run pytest tests/test_ofdm_generator.py -v                           # Task 5 ✓

# All examples work with UV
uv run demo-basic      # ✓
uv run demo-gpu        # ✓
uv run demo-chirp      # ✓
uv run demo-ofdm       # ✓
uv run demo-generator  # ✓
```

### Test Results

- **Total Tests**: 112 tests across all tasks
- **Passed**: 105 tests ✓
- **Skipped**: 7 tests (GPU-specific, expected when CuPy not available)
- **Failed**: 0 tests ✓

All tests pass when executed with `uv run pytest`, confirming proper UV integration.

## Future Tasks

For remaining tasks (6-15), the same UV-based approach should be followed:

1. **Use `uv run` for all Python execution**
2. **Add dependencies with `uv add`**
3. **Test with `uv run pytest`**
4. **Create examples runnable with `uv run`**
5. **Update UV scripts in pyproject.toml**
6. **Document UV commands in task descriptions**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **UV not found**: Install with `pip install uv`
2. **Dependencies not synced**: Run `uv sync`
3. **Import errors**: Use `uv run` for all Python commands
4. **Lock file conflicts**: Run `uv lock --upgrade`

### Debugging Commands

```bash
uv info                    # Show UV environment info
uv pip list               # List installed packages
uv run python --version   # Check Python version in UV environment
uv sync --verbose         # Verbose dependency resolution
```

## Conclusion

UV is fully integrated throughout the OFDM Chirp Generator project, providing:

- **Consistent environments** across all development activities
- **Reproducible builds** with lock file management
- **Streamlined workflow** with unified tooling
- **Reliable dependency management** with conflict resolution
- **Fast execution** of development tasks

All current tasks (1-5) work perfectly with UV, and the foundation is established for implementing remaining tasks using the same UV-based approach.
