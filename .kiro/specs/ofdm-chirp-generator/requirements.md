# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a GPU-accelerated OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) signal generator that creates signals with chirp-modulated subcarriers. The system generates multiple orthogonal OFDM signals that can be transmitted simultaneously and later separated through phase analysis. Each OFDM signal consists of multiple subcarriers, where each subcarrier carries a chirp signal with configurable phase offsets to ensure orthogonality between different OFDM signals.

## Development Environment Requirements

The project uses UV (Astral's Python package manager) for dependency management, virtual environment management, and task execution. All development tasks must be executed through UV to ensure consistent environments and reproducible builds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a signal processing engineer, I want to generate OFDM signals with configurable parameters, so that I can create signals tailored to specific communication scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL accept configuration parameters for number of subcarriers, bandwidth per subcarrier, subcarrier spacing, and central frequency
2. WHEN generating an OFDM signal THEN the system SHALL create the specified number of subcarriers with the configured spacing and bandwidth
3. WHEN setting the central frequency THEN the system SHALL position all subcarriers symmetrically around this frequency
4. IF invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a signal processing engineer, I want each subcarrier to carry a chirp signal with configurable phase, so that I can control the signal characteristics for orthogonality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a subcarrier THEN the system SHALL generate a chirp signal with predefined length
2. WHEN configuring chirp parameters THEN the system SHALL allow independent phase setting for each subcarrier
3. WHEN generating the chirp THEN the system SHALL use linear frequency modulation within the subcarrier bandwidth
4. IF chirp length exceeds reasonable bounds THEN the system SHALL validate and constrain the parameter

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a signal processing engineer, I want to generate multiple orthogonal OFDM signals efficiently, so that I can create signals that can be transmitted simultaneously without interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating multiple OFDM signals THEN the system SHALL create signals with orthogonal phase relationships
2. WHEN two signals overlap in time THEN they SHALL be separable through phase analysis
3. WHEN configuring the number of signals THEN the system SHALL support generation of at least 16 orthogonal signals
4. IF insufficient orthogonal combinations exist THEN the system SHALL report the maximum achievable count

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a signal processing engineer, I want GPU acceleration using CuPy, so that I can generate large numbers of signals efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize CuPy for GPU computation
2. WHEN generating signals THEN all mathematical operations SHALL be performed on GPU when possible
3. WHEN GPU is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to CPU computation
4. WHEN processing large signal arrays THEN GPU memory usage SHALL be monitored and managed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a signal processing engineer, I want automatic orthogonal phase discovery, so that I can find optimal phase combinations for maximum signal separation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for orthogonal signals THEN the system SHALL test different phase combinations systematically
2. WHEN evaluating orthogonality THEN the system SHALL compute cross-correlation between signal pairs
3. WHEN a valid orthogonal set is found THEN the system SHALL store the phase configuration
4. IF no orthogonal solution exists THEN the system SHALL report the best available approximation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a signal processing engineer, I want signal separation capabilities, so that I can verify that overlapping signals can be distinguished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two orthogonal signals are combined THEN the system SHALL be able to separate them
2. WHEN performing separation THEN the system SHALL use phase-based correlation analysis
3. WHEN separation is successful THEN the system SHALL report separation quality metrics
4. IF separation fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about the failure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a signal processing engineer, I want configurable signal generation parameters, so that I can adapt the system to different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL accept sampling rate, signal duration, and amplitude parameters
2. WHEN changing parameters THEN the system SHALL validate parameter compatibility
3. WHEN parameters affect orthogonality THEN the system SHALL recalculate orthogonal phase sets
4. IF parameter changes invalidate existing configurations THEN the system SHALL notify the user

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want to use UV for all package management and task execution, so that I have a consistent and reproducible development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN UV SHALL be used for virtual environment creation and management
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN UV SHALL be used for all package installations and updates
3. WHEN running tests THEN UV SHALL be used to execute pytest in the managed environment
4. WHEN executing any development task THEN UV SHALL be used to ensure consistent Python environment and dependencies
5. WHEN building or packaging the project THEN UV SHALL be used for build processes
6. IF UV is not available THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a signal processing engineer, I want centralized configuration management using TOML files, so that I can easily configure and customize all system parameters without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from a config.toml file using Dynaconf
2. WHEN configuration parameters are needed THEN the system SHALL load them from the centralized configuration
3. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL validate and report specific errors
4. WHEN configuration files are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and optionally create a default config.toml
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload parameters without requiring code changes
6. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issues
